# Platform Copy Guidelines

Character limits, best practices, and format rules per platform.

## Instagram

**Feed caption:** Up to 2,200 characters, but only first 125 visible before "more." Front-load the hook.
**Hashtags:** 3-5 relevant hashtags. Place at end or in first comment. Avoid hashtag stuffing.
**Story text:** 5-8 words max overlaid on visual. Tappable sticker CTAs perform well.
**Reel caption:** Short and punchy. Under 100 characters ideal. The video does the talking.
**Bio link CTA:** "Link in bio" is standard. Use specific: "Shop the look — link in bio."

## TikTok

**Caption:** Up to 4,000 characters but keep under 150 for visibility.
**Tone:** Conversational, trend-aware, self-aware humor works. Avoid corporate speak.
**Hashtags:** 3-5, mix trending + niche. #FYP is generally unnecessary now.
**On-screen text:** Short, bold, immediate. First frame should hook. Use contrast for readability.
**Hook formats:** Question, bold claim, "POV:", "Wait for it", "Things that just make sense"

## Twitter/X

**Tweet:** 280 characters max. Under 200 performs better (room for RT quote).
**Tone:** Sharp, witty, culturally literate. Write for retweets.
**Hashtags:** 1-2 max. Organic, not forced. Many brands skip them entirely.
**Thread format:** First tweet must standalone. Number if over 3 tweets.

## LinkedIn

**Post:** Up to 3,000 characters. First 2-3 lines must hook before "see more."
**Tone:** Professional but not boring. Thought leadership angle. Connect to industry trends.
**Hashtags:** 3-5, industry-relevant. Place at end.
**Best practices:** Personal stories outperform corporate announcements. Ask questions. Use line breaks for readability.

## YouTube

**Title:** Under 60 characters. Front-load keywords. No clickbait that doesn't deliver.
**Description:** First 150 characters appear in search. Include keywords naturally.
**Tags:** 5-10 relevant tags mixing broad and specific.
**Thumbnail text:** 3-5 words max, high contrast, readable at mobile size.

## General On-Screen Text Rules

- 3-5 words per text card maximum
- Minimum 2 seconds on screen for readability
- White text needs shadow, stroke, or dark bar behind it on bright imagery
- CAPS for headlines, sentence case for subtitles
- Time text to reinforce what the viewer sees, not compete with it
- Lower thirds: left-aligned, bottom 20% of frame
- Full-screen text: centered, with generous padding from edges

## CTA Best Practices

| Context | Strong CTAs | Weak CTAs |
|---|---|---|
| Commerce | "Shop now", "Get yours" | "Click here", "Learn more" |
| Content | "Watch the full story", "See the collection" | "Check it out" |
| Engagement | "Tag someone who...", "Drop a 🔥" | "Like and share" |
| Brand | "Join the movement", "Find your [product]" | "Visit our website" |
