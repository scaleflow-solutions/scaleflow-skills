# Tone of Voice Guide

How to translate brand voice keywords into actionable copy direction using descriptor pairs.

---

## How Descriptor Pairs Work

Brand voice keywords are single words (e.g., "Bold"). Descriptor pairs add nuance by defining what the voice IS and what it is NOT. This prevents copy from overshooting the tone.

**Format:** "[Voice keyword] but not [extreme]"

Every piece of copy should feel like it lives in the space between the two sides.

- Approachable but not simplistic
- Playful but not childish

## Industry-Specific Tone Notes

### Sports & Fitness
- Use present tense, active voice: "Run. Recover. Repeat."
- Short sentences create rhythm and urgency
- Reference sport culture naturally — use the audience's language
- Numbers beat adjectives: "90 minutes" not "a long time"
- Avoid gendered clichés unless the brief calls for them

### Fashion & Lifestyle
- Aspirational but grounded in real moments
- Sensory language — textures, movement, light
- Avoid over-describing the product; let the image do that
- Cultural references (art, music, film) add depth

### Food & Beverage
- Sensory triggers: taste, smell, texture, temperature
- Occasion-based framing: "Your 3pm pick-me-up" not "A caffeinated beverage"
- Avoid health claims unless verified
- Indulgence language for premium, simplicity for everyday

### Technology
- Clarity over cleverness — explain what it does, not how smart you are
- Benefit-first: "Save 4 hours a week" not "AI-powered automation engine"
- Avoid jargon unless the audience is technical
- Future-facing but not sci-fi

### Healthcare
- Empathetic but not patronizing
- Clear, factual claims — no exaggeration
- Inclusive language, avoid assumptions about ability
- Regulatory-aware — flag any claims that need medical/legal review

### Real Estate
- Location-specific: neighborhood names, landmarks, lifestyle cues
- Aspiration through lifestyle, not just square footage
- Avoid superlatives without proof: "the best location" needs backing

## Applying Voice to Different Copy Formats

| Format | Voice Application |
|---|---|
| Tagline | Distill voice to its purest form. 3-7 words. |
| Headline | Voice at high energy. Punchy, immediate. |
| Social caption | Voice at conversational level. Platform tone modifies it. |
| Body copy | Voice at its most nuanced. Full sentences, narrative. |
| CTA | Voice compressed to action. 2-4 words. |
| On-screen text | Voice at maximum compression. Every word visual. |

## Red Flags — Copy That's Off-Voice

Watch for these signs that copy has drifted from the intended voice:

- **Too many exclamation marks** — usually means the words aren't doing the work
- **Buzzwords and jargon** — "leverage", "synergy", "cutting-edge" — unless the brand actually talks this way
- **Passive voice** — "The product was designed to..." kills energy
- **Generic openers** — "In today's world...", "Are you tired of...", "Introducing..."
- **Mixed tone in one piece** — starting formal and ending casual, or vice versa
- **Trying too hard** — if the copy feels like it's performing, it's off-voice
