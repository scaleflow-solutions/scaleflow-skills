## Composition Patterns

### Rule of Thirds

Subject placed at intersection points. Dynamic, natural, photographic. Best for: lifestyle imagery, environmental portraits, product-in-context shots.

### Centered Symmetry

Subject dead center. Powerful, confrontational, iconic. Best for: hero product shots, portrait campaigns, brand statements.

### Diagonal Dynamism

Key elements along diagonal lines. Energetic, movement, sports. Best for: action shots, athletic campaigns, anything conveying speed or motion.

### Negative Space Dominant

Subject occupies <30% of frame. Breathing room, luxury, text placement. Best for: headline-heavy layouts, minimal aesthetics, billboard formats.

### Tight Crop

Subject fills or exceeds frame. Intimate, intense, detailed. Best for: product close-ups, emotional portraits, texture-focused imagery.

### Layered Depth

Multiple depth planes (foreground, subject, background). Cinematic, immersive, environmental. Best for: storytelling images, video frames, campaign hero shots.

| Hero / Banner | 16:9 | Horizontal sweep, text on left or right third |
| Instagram Feed | 1:1 | Centered composition works best, tight framing |
| Instagram Story / TikTok | 9:16 | Vertical emphasis, subject fills height, text top/bottom |
| Instagram Reel cover | 1:1 crop from 9:16 | Center-weighted — key elements must survive crop |
| LinkedIn post | 1.91:1 | Wide, professional, text-safe zones on sides |
| YouTube thumbnail | 16:9 | Large text, high contrast, face if possible |
| Billboard | varies (14:48 common) | Ultra-wide, minimal text, high contrast, simple composition |
| Print A4/Letter | ~1:1.4 | Vertical or portrait, generous margins, bleed consideration |

## Color Palette Building Rules

1. **Start from brand colors** — the brand profile provides the foundation; extend, don't replace
2. **5-7 colors per campaign** — enough for variety, not so many it loses coherence
3. **60-30-10 rule** — 60% dominant color, 30% secondary, 10% accent
4. **Name colors conceptually** — "stadium shadow blue" tells a story, "#1a2b3c" does not
5. **Specify format shifts** — darker for video, brighter for social, muted for print
6. **Define exclusions** — colors to actively avoid (competitor colors, clashing tones)
