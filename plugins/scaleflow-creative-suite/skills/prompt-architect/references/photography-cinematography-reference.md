## 3D Input Image Preparation

When generating images to feed into 3D models (Trellis, Rodin, Hunyuan):
- White or light gray background — clean isolation
- Clear, even lighting — no harsh shadows
- Single object, centered, filling most of the frame
- Show the most informative angle (3/4 view — front and one side)
- High resolution and sharp focus
- Avoid busy textures or patterns
